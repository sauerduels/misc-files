@everyone .

**IMPORTANT**
All events will start at 6:00 PM (CET) and finish about 2-3 hours. Please be present on discord during the event for details like game times, and do not disconnect from a game before intermission.

DO NOT give out the server IP for any reason whatsoever, the IP is for players only. If someone leaks the IP, it puts us at risk a higher risk of DDoS, and we may decide to ban you from playing in future tournaments.


**SERVERS**
For a quick-connect menu, paste the following commands into your console:

```/sd = [push s "SauerDuels Servers" [newgui $s [push F [guilist [loop i $arg3 [push n (+ $i 1) [guibutton (format "%1 #%2" $arg1 $n) [connect @arg2 @[n]0000]]]]] [guilist [F EU "eu-ip" 5; guibar; F NA "na-ip" 5]]]; showgui $s]]```

Then do `/sd` to open the menu. Note that you will need to re-enter this command for every new tournament.
