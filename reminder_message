@everyone 

**IMPORTANT**
All events will last about 2-3 hours, please be on discord during the event for details like game times, and do not disconnect from a game before intermission.

DO NOT give out the IP for any reason whatsoever, the IP is for players only. If someone leaks the IP it will put us at risk a higher risk of DDoS, and we may decide to ban you from playing in future tournaments depending on the circumstances.


**SERVERS**
For a quick-connect menu, paste the following command into your console:

```/sd = [newgui sdgui [loop i 4 [guibutton (concatword "Server #" (+ $i 1)) [connect xx.xx.xx.xx @(concatword (+ $i 1) "0000")]]]; showgui sdgui]```


Then do `/sd` to open the menu, note that you will need to re-enter this command for every new tournament.

Command-line cmd: `/connect xx.xx.xx.xx 10000|20000|30000|40000`
